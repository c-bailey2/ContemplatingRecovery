  <h1>My journey through recovery.</h1>
  <div id="door">
  	<p> Behind this door is a story of my journey through mental health crisis and into recovery. As such the first sections touch on subjects that may be difficult to take in. I have processed this time in my life and think it is valuable to share, but I urge you to consider whether or not you are in the right space to hear discussion around any of the following areas: suicide attempts, hospitalizations, self harm, alcohol and drug abuse, sexual assualt, or disordered eating.</p>
  	<p>If at any point during your exploration it becomes too much, please step away and take care of yourself or refresh the page and return here so you can go directly to the stories of my recovery journey.</p>
