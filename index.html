			<h1>Contemplating Recovery</h1>
    		<h2>A journey from near-death to self discovery</h2>
    		<p>
    			It is the start of May, 2021, and my room is a mess. I've pulled out every piece of art from therapy, every journal from my hospitalizations, and my DBT binder. External harddrives and cloud storage are raked through for every morsel of my writing. We don't necessarily take a lot of time to look back. At the start of recovery it felt like looking back and reflecting on my past was all I did. The thing about getting better is you can stop focusing on the past. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			For the first time in years I pull out the thick binder from my 48-week out-patient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy program and flip through every page. Five sections of typed handouts covered in notes and doodles on the margins. A whole section of diary cards. For over a year I tracked every day how I felt. What medications I took prescribed or over the counter. If I did any street drugs or drank any alcohol. Ratings on a scale from 1-5 of my suicidal ideation, misery, and urge to self harm. Whether or not I acted on that urge. And room for custom columns to track. For me we track if I pertook in any disordered eating behaviors. Looking back I can see the process of recovery in numbers. Cards where the numbers start high and all the time and card by card, week by week, the high numbers dissapear and my ratings are mostly 0's.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			This page is a collection of writings, old and new. Photos from the back of my camera roll. And doodles taken straight from the pages of my binder. It's a look inside my thoughts past and present. An invitation to travel with me on the journey of my recovery.

		<h3>To the well-intentioned nurse who said “but you’re so young and pretty”</h3>
		<pre>
			Why do people say young and pretty?
					Young and pretty

			Not smart
				Talented
				Creative
				Caring

			Young and pretty
				Two qualities I did not earn
				Two qualities that do not last

			Tell me I’m inspiring
			Tell me i’m an individual

			Tell me I am a completely unique and complex combination 
			of neurons, chemicals, and atoms that 
			just happen to be wrapped in skin.

			Tell me there is nothing you can say
			to condense and convey the unlimited futures I could be proud to have

			Or at least tell me what you tell the attractive young man, 
			because those descriptors are not the ones you gift to him.

			Don’t tell me I’m young and pretty 
			like mental illness has a type and I’m not it. 

			Like those are the threads tying me here 
			that the scissors of suicide should know not to cut

			Young and pretty is not incompatible with pain

			Young and pretty can also stand at the edge of the cliff, 
			weighed down by her baggage 
			convinced the step forward is easier than the journey back home.

			And it is. 

				Easier.


			So tell me I’m brave
			Tell me i’m strong
			Or tell me nothing

			Your misplaced compliment feels too much like critique 
			too much like hollowing me out to the 2d pill easier for you to swallow.

			Spit me out, swallow your tongue

			And save young and pretty for someone foolish enough to think 
			that’s the BEST they could be.

		<h4>The Final Time</h4>
		<p>I called her up to say goodbye. I just knew I wanted to hear her voice. Hearing her voice turns into hearing her cry and running to her side to shit talk the guy who's breaking her heart. </p>
		<p>By the time I am sitting on her bed, brushing crumbs off my fingers and onto my lap, the handfuls of pills I swallowed is a distance memory. By the time I curl my body into a small crescent moon on the corner of her bed, I have already forgotten I am in the process of dying. My internal organs begin to fail, the space between my heartbeats spread. I am dying the same way bad things often happen: quickly, quietly, and without warning.</p>

		<h4>Critcal Sophie</h4>

		<pre>
In the timeline drafted by my memory there are no events between 
eating a slice of fridge pizza in my best friends bed and 
waking up in the white-washed hospital room with a tube 
snaking its way down my throat.

Saturday night - I was Chelsea Bailey
	Highly desirable employee
	Hot piece of ass wrapped in black corset and tight red pants
	Friend, flirt, on top of the world

Monday morning I am Critical Sophie.
	Bunched up clothes in a plastic bag
	Pale body in a bed with blue sheets
	Empty shell that needs a machine to breath
		</pre>

		<p>Critical Sophie is Jane Doe when Jane Doe is banging on death’s door. Critical Sophie is more adjective than name, more condition than human.</p>
		<p>Although I get the gory details later, it is immediately clear that this one, this one was bad. The worst by far. First there were the tubes. Then there was Critical Sophie. This was the first time they took my body and my name got left behind.</p>

				Every girl I knew who was sexually assaulted at Olin, withdrew or transferred. Every perpetrator I knew walked with their class at graduation, including mine.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Every friday for two years I walked past the second floor hallway in Milas Hall to the weekly meeting for R2s. Every time I passed the wall of twin photos. For each class a picture from freshman orientation and a picture from graduation. The same faces all in the same order on the steps of the wooden waterfall. A time capsule tradition. Every time I saw my class’s orientation photo and the blank space beneath it that waited for our graduation photo, I wondered how I would be handled. The boy I sat next to at the start of orientation became the boy I worked with student life to create a no-contact order with. An order that started with no contact and progressed to keep a minimum distance of 30 feet between us. I wondered who would sit where. How we could rearrange without revealing to everyone the things I tightrope walked around for years to keep private. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All that wondering and in the end it didn’t matter. I never made it to that graduation photo. I never made it to graduation.

			<h1> Who even am I anymore? </h1>
			<p> The thing about being sick all your life is that you don't know who you are without your illness. It becomes so entangled with your identity, this dark cloud that colors every experience and every trait. </p>
			<p> The first time I felt anxious I was in the first grade. The first time I felt depressed I was in the third. Neither of those feelings went away.</p>
			<p> Every relationship I had, platonic and romantic, happened while I was sick. In the five years since recovery I haven't put myself out there. I haven't engaged in my first healthy relationship unaffected by illness. I think I'm afraid. I don't know what healthy looks like.</p>
			<p> For a time I think it's why I pushed back on recovery. Fought it. What if everything special about me would be lost when I got better. What if I couldn't write anymore. Couldn't create the same level of art. Hating myself, hurting myself, that was all I knew. I wasn't sure I wanted to know anything else.</p>
			<p> At some point in recovery I start questioning even the things I took for granted as clearly being parts of my identity. Some of them look too much like statistics for my sickness. How I used to dye my hair. Shave my head. Got tattoos and piercings. My queerness. Were those things me or just symptoms? It's a journey where some days I have no doubts. On others I'm still asking if I know myself at all.</p>
			<p>Parts work helped some. Internal family systems. Therapies based around identifying what parts of you are self and what parts are not. And learning to accept the parts that aren't self as parts that are still a part of you. It helps me understand the part that meekly shuts the door on solicitors, and the part that awakens with rage to fly through the door and chew them out. The vulnerable part, the protective part. And on good days, on days where I can see the different parts of myself and accept them enough to tuck them away, I am what's left. This is how I've learned to understand self. This is how I find me.</p>
